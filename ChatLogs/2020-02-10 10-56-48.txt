xdstone:@DrLupo from personal experience you have to be travelling at no less than 5mph but if you really want to get the job done you steal his bike and do a flying kick off of it at top speed
death00knight:@DrLupo In order to calculate that Dr. Lupo we will need the precise elevation the kick will take place at, the approximate weight of the child within 5 lbs, and lastly how far you can punt a 50lbs weight at sealevel.
cryptowalking:@TitaniumTeddyBear they do sir.
starchipmunk510:@DrLupo has your game ever launched with just a black screen, if so how did you fix it?
