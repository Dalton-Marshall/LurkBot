welldressedgamer:@DrLupo alright the numbers are in, assuming an average 7 y/o boy's height/weight of 112 cm/23.13 kg (51 lbs), we can assume the fall time will be for ~75% of their height giving us an airtime of 0.87 seconds to get them through a window. Also assuming an peak gamer bod of 68.49 kg (151 lbs) and a vertical jump height of 0.76 m (2.5 feet) we can say there is an available 115 N of force deliverable at the moment of impact. This yields a distance to target window of ~4.58 m. Hope this helps.
